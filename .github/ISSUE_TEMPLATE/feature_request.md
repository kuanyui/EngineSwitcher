# ATTENTION!
I basically don't accept any feature request anymore. Because:
1. If this feature is really required my my self, I should have already implemented. The requirements of these people are mostly not fit my need. 
2. My free time is so fucking rare. I have no interest nor time to satisfy more and more strangers who only want others work for them and for free. I have enough of it.

HOWEVER, if you are planning to open a Pull Request, you CAN open this Feature Request issue first before opening a PR to discuss and confirm the spec you are going to do, to avoid wasting your precious time.
